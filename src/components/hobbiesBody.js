        <p>Every week i'm doing something related to rpg, playing, creating, studying and watching! This an interpretation game where you and some friends can make and play
          a story. The "master", it's who created all the universe and tells the story for the players, who interprets the protagonists of the story. To play this there is a
          bunch of systems and each one has it's own characteristics, the most famous for medieval stories is Dungeons & Dragons. Currently i'm creating an story based on 
          a brazilian system created this year, called "Ordem Paranormal". And I watch it's episodes every saturday.

        <h1>Scouting</h1>
        <div>
          <img src="/images/scout.jpg" width="300"/>
          <img src="/images/scout2.jpeg" width="300"/>
          <img src="/images/scout3.jpeg" width="300"/>
          <img src="/images/scout4.jpeg" width="300"/>
        </div>
        <p>For more than 8 years in my life I participated the scout fraternity, this is an underrated thing to do by a lot of people, and every one don't know that lost for
          not entering this. One of the first places I learned team work and the importance of soft-skills, everything about it, is team work. Camping, building with logs,
          here you can learn almost everything, here I lerned to cook, to give first aid in accidents and health problems, to support others in difficult times, and first of
          all, to challenge myself. With 17 years old I got out of my last group to study for entrance exams. And now I'm looking to come back, after you experience you never want
          to stop. Once a scout, always a scout.

        <h1>Games</h1>
        <div>

          <img src="/images/sea.jpg" width="535.5"/>
        </div>
        <p>
          Like sports,I practice games every week, I'm not that good but this is the point, the objective is to get good. Train for every situacion, fast and smart thinking.
          Sometimes is good for relaxing, after a hard day for example. The secret of the games it's their competitiveness, we are always looking for be better than the others,
          each lost, each win is a step forward, learn with your mistakes, get better and continue climbing up. And probaly the most important thing, you can be the best, perfect moves, 
          perfect aim, if you do not team work, you already lost.
